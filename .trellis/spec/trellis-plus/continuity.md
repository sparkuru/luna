## Goal

Preserve project intent across task boundaries without creating a second task
system. `.trellis/mainline.md` summarizes direction, approval boundaries, and
progress. Source PRDs/designs retain detailed requirements; Trellis parent and
child tasks retain plans, checks, commits, and archive evidence.

## Import Existing Requirements

At bootstrap, inspect project-local requirements supplied or referenced by the
user and documents serving the same role as `prd.md`, `design.md`, briefs, or
roadmaps. Bound discovery to the project; exclude dependencies, generated
examples, and archived alternatives unless the user identifies them as current.
Filenames are clues, not proof of authority or recency.

Before Trellis initialization, inventory these sources read-only. If init is
already authorized, use the installed initialization workflow, then import.
Otherwise report the prerequisite and candidates without creating a partial
`.trellis/` tree. Resume the import after initialization.

For each relevant source, extract:

- desired outcome, intended users, and core use cases;
- in-scope behavior, non-goals, and technical/product constraints;
- observable acceptance criteria and unresolved decisions;
- evidence of approval, supersession, or draft status;
- proposed work/dependencies only where the source actually establishes them.

Create or merge `.trellis/mainline.md` without moving, deleting, or rewriting
the source documents. Cite repository-relative source paths and sections; use
existing revision/date information when useful, without inventing metadata.
Keep the mainline concise: summarize and link instead of copying entire PRDs.

Carry forward already approved requirements without requesting approval again.
For drafts, preserve useful direction as `proposed`, set the active objective
to `not yet approved` if necessary, and list the decision still needed. Preserve
established approval and supersession precedence: an older unapproved design
does not reopen an approved PRD merely because they differ. Record alternatives
as unapproved or superseded. Conflicting authoritative sources, or genuinely
unclear authority affecting current acceptance, require an unresolved choice;
neither filename nor modification time alone authorizes selecting one. Proposed
direction grants no implementation or serial-continuation authority.

On rerun, merge new evidence into the same record, preserving accepted decisions
and user edits. Do not replace an established mainline with an older source or
silently promote an inferred feature into approved work.

## Control Record

Create or update `.trellis/mainline.md` with this template. Keep the ordered
child list explicit; task-tree position does not imply ordering or readiness.

```markdown
# Trellis Mainline

## Initiative

- title: <approved initiative name>
- parent task: <.trellis/tasks/<parent-slug>, or none>
- objective: <user-approved outcome>
- owner decision: <date and concise authorization/source>

## Requirements And Sources

- source documents: <repository-relative paths and relevant sections>
- approved scope and acceptance: <concise outcomes or links>
- constraints and non-goals: <current boundaries>
- proposed or conflicting requirements: <unapproved items, or none>

## Continuation

- mode: guided
- serial authorization: none
- next pulse: <no-task | after archive | user-requested>

## Ordered Work

| order | task / proposed child | state | readiness and dependency evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | <task path or approved child slug> | <planned | active | complete | blocked> | <why it is ready, or what blocks it> |

## Evidence and Decisions

- completed evidence: <archived task, commit, validation, or none>
- current blocker / dirty-state warning: <none or concrete issue>
- next user decision: <none or the one decision needed>
```

For a draft-only import, label title/objective and work rows as proposed rather
than filling the approved fields with assumptions. Use `guided` unless the
user explicitly authorizes a bounded serial initiative.
For serial mode, replace `serial authorization: none` with the approved
initiative, allowed child list/order, and stop conditions. Do not infer an
objective, rank an unapproved backlog, or use repository code as authority for
product priority.

## Lifecycle Maintenance

Read mainline and source requirements at task start. Map the task's acceptance
criteria to the approved outcome; if it does not fit, resolve the actual scope
conflict before implementation instead of silently changing the objective.

- On an approved requirement change, update scope, constraints, acceptance,
  source references, affected work, and the decision record together. Reuse
  explicit authorization already in the conversation.
- On task creation/start, link the normal Trellis task and update its state,
  ordering, and dependencies only within approved work. Do not create a second
  task schema or scheduler.
- After checks, record verified results and unresolved limitations. Keep
  implemented-but-unverified behavior distinct from completed acceptance.
- At archive, update task location, work/archival evidence, completed scope,
  remaining work, and next decision. Follow the task-archive attribution
  reference for the archive commit; a later mainline-only update does not add
  another trailer.
- On later evidence or user corrections, reconcile the record without erasing
  still-applicable requirements. Implementation drift is not a reason to
  weaken acceptance criteria or mark unfinished work complete.

Preserve a concise record of meaningful decisions, not a second detailed
journal. Keep task-specific diagnostics and test output in their task records.

## Project Pulse

Run a read-only Project Pulse only for project-relevant no-task requests, such
as continuing work, asking for status or next steps, beginning implementation,
or immediately after a task archive. Read the control record, active and
archived task evidence, git state, and available validation results. Report:

1. current initiative and completed evidence;
2. blocker or dirty-state warning;
3. one ready candidate when uniquely determined; and
4. the next permitted action.

| Evidence | Pulse result | Permitted action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| No record or no declared objective | State the missing evidence. | Ask for one product-priority decision. |
| `paused` mode | Report the recorded state only. | Do not create a task or edit code. |
| Dirty worktree, unresolved check, or incomplete archive evidence | Report the exact condition. | Resolve or obtain direction before continuing. |
| `guided` mode with one ready child | Recommend that child and its evidence. | Wait for the user to choose. |
| `guided` mode with multiple or unclear candidates | Report the competing evidence. | Ask the user to order or choose. |
| Explicit `serial` authorization with one listed, ready child | Name the authorized child and boundaries. | Run its normal Trellis lifecycle. |
| Missing dependency, risk, scope change, or new decision | State the stop condition. | Stop and ask for direction. |

Do not run a Pulse merely because the user asks an unrelated question. Do not
use `completed` as a continuation trigger: after archive the active-task
resolver cannot expose that state. Run the next Pulse from the relevant
no-task or post-archive request instead.

## Continuation Authority

| Mode | Default behavior | Authority boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `guided` | Pulse and recommend one action. | Never create a task or edit product files until the user chooses. |
| `serial` | Continue one listed, ready child after a clean archive. | Requires explicit bounded authorization; stop on ambiguity, risk, scope change, or unmet dependency. |
| `paused` | Report state only. | No task creation or implementation. |

Serial authorization substitutes only for repeated consent to create or start a
listed, ready child. It does not waive required PRD/design/plan artifacts,
checks, human-review gates, commit decisions, or archive evidence. A proposed
child becomes work only through the normal Trellis task lifecycle and must be
linked to the declared initiative parent when one exists.

## Conductor and Worker Protocol

The main session owns phase selection, Pulse, acceptance-criteria mapping,
task creation/start, dispatch, commit, archive, and control-record updates.
Research, implementation, and check workers receive only a bounded active task.
They report files changed, validation, and unresolved decisions; they do not
choose the next child, archive independently, perform project-wide cleanup, or
recursively dispatch implement/check workers.

## Injection Guidance

Patch only these durable project files:

1. Create or merge `.trellis/mainline.md` from the control-record template when
   the project has a declared initiative or relevant source requirements.
   Label proposed direction explicitly. With neither, leave the record absent
   rather than inventing a product goal.
2. Add a short `Trellis Plus: Mainline Continuity` section to the shared
   `.trellis/spec/trellis-plus/index.md` (or a detail file beside it). It must
   say to run the read-only Pulse for relevant requests, default to `guided`,
   honor `paused`, and permit serial work only under recorded explicit
   authorization.
3. Add the shared spec path to active task context when delegated work needs
   it. A personal/local adapter may point to the shared rule when a platform
   cannot load it. Do not patch `.trellis/workflow.md`, hooks, runtime scripts,
   or task schema.

Preserve existing wording and state names when reading the workflow. Trellis
Plus reads the shared continuity rule on each relevant run; removing the
project-owned rule and `.trellis/mainline.md` restores the prior Trellis Plus
behavior without changing Trellis's workflow parser.

## Verification

- Confirm root AGENTS directs the main session to read this policy and mainline.
- Confirm the record names an approved objective, parent when applicable, mode,
  ordered work, readiness/dependency evidence, and next decision, or explicitly
  labels a draft-only import as unapproved.
- Confirm approved source requirements import without redundant approval,
  conflicting drafts remain unresolved, and source documents stay intact.
- Confirm rerunning import preserves accepted decisions and does not duplicate
  work rows; task start, accepted changes, checks, and archive update the record.
- Confirm the shared continuity rule is in `.trellis/spec/trellis-plus/`.
- Confirm `.trellis/workflow.md` and other protected Trellis files were not
  modified or staged.
- Forward-read a no-record request: it reports evidence and asks for direction.
- Forward-read `guided`: it recommends but does not create work or edit code.
- Forward-read authorized `serial`: it advances one ready listed child through
  normal create/plan/implement/check/commit/archive flow, then returns to Pulse.
- Confirm ambiguous, dirty, risky, scope-changing, or blocked work stops for a
  user decision.
- Confirm no workflow text claims `completed` runs after archive and no new
  scheduler, daemon, hook, or task schema was introduced.
